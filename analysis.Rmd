title: "Data Analysis for the AI Paper"
description: |
  The aim of this study was to analyse the role of acceptance and confidence in technology in regards to the need for regula- tions to ensure the fair use of artificial intelligence. Scientific discussions of artificial intelligence are conducted in a variety of disciplines. The connections between social perception of the fairness of artificial intel- ligence, the acceptance of technology and the establishment of artificial intelligence had not been sufficiently investigated yet. In order to gain new insights, a quantitative questionnaire was used to empirically and deductively study the previously formulated research question and esta- blished hypotheses. Overall, the results suggest confidence in technology has an impact on assessing the fairness of AI, and it correlates with regu- latory needs. Furthermore, the assessment of AI fairness and regulatory needs influence each other. According to this study, acceptance of tech- nology does not correlate with regulatory necessities. To conclude, some relevant topics are presented for possible future research.
